This is a collaborative project developed by a team of passionate students from Paris-Saclay University.The aim of the project is to provide an online platform that allows students to borrow and lend items to each other. As the lead developer for the project, I have been responsible for designing and implementing the backend and database components of the platform.

The database is designed to efficiently store and manage information about the items available for borrowing, as well as user profiles and borrowing history. It is built using the latest technologies and follows best practices for data modeling and database design.

The backend is implemented using a modern web framework that allows for efficient handling of user requests, as well as secure authentication and authorization.

As a student at Paris-Saclay University, I am deeply invested in campus life and passionate about building tools that make student life easier and more enjoyable. This project is a testament to my dedication to using my technical skills to contribute to the university community.

Feel free to contact me for more information about this project or to discuss potential collaboration opportunities.
